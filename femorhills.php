<center><h3>Femor Hills</h3></center><center><img border="2" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/library/map_femorhills.jpg"></center><br>Femor Hills are located in north-central Tibia. As they are a difficult terrain with many small hills, even the road from Thais to Carlin gives them a wide berth. Only some tribes of wild goblins live in this inhospitable area and ambush travellers that try to find a shortcut on their way to Carlin. In former days, the inhabitants of Carlin prospected for mineral resources in the hills, and the old tunnels are still worth an investigation. </div>
