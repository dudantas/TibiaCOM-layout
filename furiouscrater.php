<center><h3>Furious Crater</h3></center><center><img border="2" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/library/map_furiouscrater.jpg"></center><br>The Furious Crater, an abondoned land mass shaped in shrinking circles driven deep into the mountain, is located east of Kilmaresh. Uninhabitable by the living, the small island was taken over by undead creatures that do not only endure the electrically charged environment but thrive on it. So if the charged up air is not enough to make any adventurer's hair stand on end, these monsters will gladly take the job.<br> But if brave enough to face all of the above, descending into the crater leads through the vaste and blood stained surroundings to the bottom of this hellhole, where you will find one of Goshnar's fettered vices. </div>
