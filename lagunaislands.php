<center><h3>Laguna Islands</h3></center><center><img border="2" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/library/map_lagunaislands.jpg"></center><br>In the south-eastern part of the Shattered Isles, adventurers can visit the Laguna Islands. Palm trees and banana plants grow plenty on the 3 idyllic isles. Long sandy beaches and crystal clear water invite to a sunbath. But watch out, the archipelago has also a rich wildlife. Not all creatures are as harmless as the cackling seagulls. Many a shipwrecked sailor has been attacked by innocent-looking amphibians such as multi-coloured frogs or slimy toads. </div>
